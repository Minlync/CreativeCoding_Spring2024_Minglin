How to interactive with the screen ?

when you press the  RIGHT_ARROW the scene will move into the next scene. 

first scene is in the dark night and a circle mask moving around to makes a effects as the lunar eclipse.

i also use a moving rect to makea shadow -> the circle mask will arrive later.
 i use the for loop random in the start also frame counter to control the star twinkletiming ans size.
/when you press the  RIGHT_ARROW the scene will move into the next scene. and you will see cherry blossoms. 
-> I followed the same logic that I used in the snow logic code. I used the translation matrix scale function and also collaborated with frame counter function.


// thrid scene, when you pressed the mouse, you will see a brid flying on the sky. I used the for loop to control the clouds number let it loop over the screen.And i have also use the draw loop to making it moving on the screen. I used mouseX and mouse Y to let user to control the flying bird location.
