# CreativeCoding_Spring2024_Minglin
Midterm Project for NYU IDM Creative Coding Class 

/Apr 4 updated:removed the mouse interaction and used frameCount / sceneDuration to switch scenes

// first scene is in the dark night and a circle mask moving around to makes a effects as the lunar eclipse.

// i also use a moving rect to makea shadow -> the circle mask will arrive later.
// i use the for loop random in the start also frame counter to control the star twinkletiming ans size.
// waiting 60 seconds, you will see cherry blossoms. -> I followed the same logic that I used in the snow logic code. I used the translation matrix scale function and also collaborated with frame counter function.
